In 2018 during one of my occasional periods of attempting to eat healthily I noticed that
it was very difficult to find reliable calorie information for the foods available in UK cafes.
To resolve this I began work on an ambitious and, of course, unsuccessful project to catalogue
nutritional information from all the major high street food outlets and provide suggestions for healthier alternatives.

As part of this doomed venture I created the "Wow, Look!" charting library so that I could generate SVG graphs in Scala both on the backend and also
in the frontend using Scala JS. This ended up proving useful when writing my ["2020 in Deployments"](https://tech.ovoenergy.com/2020-in-deployments/) post for the OVO Tech Blog.
