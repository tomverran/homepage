This was an app I created to automatically unsubscribe me from the Formula 1 subreddit on race weekends so that I could
safely browse Reddit on days where the Formula 1 race was held early in the morning and repeated later in the day on free-to-air TV.
I made it possible for others to sign up and advertised the app on Reddit but it was spectacularly unpopular and no-one actually did.

Like most of my Heroku projects I killed it not long afterwards as it was fairly expensive to keep running.
