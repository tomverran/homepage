This website provided daily statistics on the UK's COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
I made it over a weekend because I was frustrated that The Guardian at the time
only published the percentage of the population vaccinated every day which made it difficult
to assess how things were going. Naturally the day after I deployed the website they started
graphing the data in much more detail.
