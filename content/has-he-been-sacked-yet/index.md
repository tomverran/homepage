Like many people in the UK I was furious when government advisor Dominic Cummings travelled the length of the country during the COVID lockdown
period and then faced no consequences for doing so. Having already expressed my displeasure by [buying some beer](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/barnard-castle-eye-test)
I created "Has he been sacked yet" as a kind of online petition for him to be sacked. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly this did not work - I ended up with about 40 signatures and a bill from Heroku while 
Dominic Cummings enjoyed another six months in government. Still, the beer was nice.
